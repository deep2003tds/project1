This project scrapes data from a specified CSV file, filtering users based on location and ranking them by follower count.
The most interesting finding was that users in certain locations have significantly higher follower counts, indicating possible regional engagement differences.
Developers should focus on building location-specific content strategies to maximize engagement in high-follower regions.
# PROJECT-1
-This project scraped data from the GitHub API, selecting users in Berlin with over 200 followers, then cleaned and standardized company names, email addresses, 
 and user information fields to ensure consistency and accuracy across the dataset. Python scripts handled data extraction, transformation, and loading to create CSV 
 files for analysis.

-The most surprising insight was the high follower count concentrated among users affiliated with a few prominent companies, suggesting that certain organizations 
 have a strong influence on GitHub visibility. This concentration highlights the significant impact that company association can have on a user’s reach within the 
 developer community.

-Developers aiming to boost their visibility should consider networking with users from these prominent companies or collaborating on open-source projects. 
 Leveraging relationships with influential organizations or high-follower developers can lead to greater exposure, helping individual contributors or smaller 
 organizations gain recognition on GitHub’s platform.
